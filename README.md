# Image Quality Mini Library

This mini library simulates real-time image quality analysis, generating mock images every 200ms, processing them with a 500ms delay, and displaying feedback on screen for a configurable duration.

## Building the Library

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (includes npm) installed. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if needed.
- A terminal (e.g., iTerm) and a web browser.

### Setup
1. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/websdk-challenge

2. Install Dependencies:
Run this to install Webpack and TypeScript (already in package.json):
```bash
    npm install

3. Run the Dev Server:
```bash
    npm run start

4. View It:

``` bash
    http://localhost:8080
